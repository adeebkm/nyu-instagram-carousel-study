# Recent Changes - Research Study Optimization

## ðŸ”§ Major Updates

### âœ… Removed localStorage Storage
- **Before:** PROLIFIC_ID was stored in browser localStorage
- **After:** No storage - each session is completely independent
- **Why:** Research study requires fresh, uncontaminated sessions

### âœ… Fixed Tracking Conflicts
- Removed all old tracking functions that conflicted with new GA4 system
- Cleaned up 100+ lines of redundant code
- Fixed tap-to-start functionality

### âœ… Enhanced PROLIFIC_ID Flow
- **URL Parameter:** `?PROLIFIC_ID=PARTICIPANT_123` (no prompt)
- **Manual Entry:** Always prompts for fresh participant ID
- **No Memory:** Each visit is treated as new session

### âœ… Added Debugging
- Console logs to track PROLIFIC_ID flow
- Easy troubleshooting for research administrators
- Clear visibility into participant identification process

## ðŸ“Š Current Tracking Events

1. **page_view** - Session start with participant ID
2. **carousel_start** - User begins carousel interaction
3. **slide_view** - Each slide view with navigation direction
4. **dwell_end** - Exact time spent on each slide (milliseconds)
5. **carousel_complete** - Overall engagement summary

## ðŸŽ¯ GA4 Configuration

- **Property ID:** G-ELZDTBWQV3
- **User ID:** PROLIFIC_ID (for participant tracking)
- **Study ID:** 'instagram_study' (all events tagged)
- **Debug Mode:** Enabled for testing

## ðŸ”¬ Research Benefits

- **Individual Participant Analysis:** Complete journey per PROLIFIC_ID
- **Millisecond Precision:** Exact time measurements per slide
- **Behavioral Patterns:** Navigation and engagement analysis
- **No Cross-Contamination:** Each session independent
- **Research-Grade Data:** Beyond standard web analytics

## ðŸš€ Ready for Deployment

The carousel is now optimized for research studies with:
- Clean participant identification
- Comprehensive tracking
- Independent sessions
- Research-grade analytics
